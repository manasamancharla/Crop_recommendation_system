#### About the project
     Crop Recommendation System is a Machine Learning Project that is used to predict crops that give maximum yield.The user provides inputs such as rainfall,temperature,soil composition, etc. to the machine learning algorithm that predicts the output crop.To predict the crop yield,selected Machine Learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine(SVM),Random Forest,Naive-Bayes Classification,Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees are used.
  
#### Objectives 
 Every part of this project is a sample code that does the following:

- Data Cleaning on collected data to remove inaccurate,incomplete and unreasonable data.
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) that helps in analysing the complete dataset and summarizing the main characteristics.
- Dividing the dataset into training and testing datasets.
- Training the machine learning model using the training dataset.
- Comparing various Algorithms by passing the analysed dataset through them and calculating the error rate and accuracy.
- Choosing the algorithm with the highest accuracy and lowest error rate.
- Implementing a system in the form of a web application and integrating the algorithm at the backend.
